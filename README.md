Hey, my name is Karolina. I'm a [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) graduate (Sept 2022).

I fell in love with coding in 2020 in the middle of my Social Anthroplogy degree and since then I've been working towards beginning my career as a software engineer. What excites me about creating software is the constant need for elegant problem-solving and life-long learning, it means nothing will ever be boring and there will always be a cool new technology to get stuck into on the horizon! The idea of creating something that helps people in their daily-life and is potentially life-changing is also incredibly exciting and motivates me to constantly evolve and aim for greatness.

I strive to become an engineer that produces simple but great-quality code in collaboration with others which is why I am currently looking for my first software engineer role to take on new challenges at a company with the same values as mine.

## Tech Stack üìö

## What I'm great at (Skills) üå±

### Project management & leading with empathy

I managed a team of 13 people to complete and present multiple media projects during my final year of university. All of our assignments were graded as firsts and I received even higher marks for my project management skills with feedback from my peers stating that they were grateful for how organised I was as it made their work easier to do. It was a really demanding but rewarding experience as it taught me scheduling and time-management, leadership, peer-review and above all communication skills. An aspect of project management that I did not foresee before I took on the role was how much of the role was motivating others and building their confidence to complete their tasks. Therefore, I decided early on in the role that I wanted to lead with empathy and ensure that my team members always felt heard and could come to me with any problems that affected their ability to complete assignments, this was really important as university can be very stressful and many people have personal problems that make things even more difficult.

### Mentoring

Mentoring has been something close to my heart for a long time, I sought out the opportunity to be a peer-mentor at university and kept in touch with 20 people during the year to ensure they had the support they needed to succeed. I also took up the opportunity to be a mentor during my time at Makers Academy which was a really special experience as I was always very grateful to my mentors when I began to code so it felt great to give back! I'd love to keep mentoring people throughout my career once I've gained more technical expertise as I believe it's super important to share knowledge and help others succeed.

### Analytical thinker & problem solver

During my time as a trustee at Student Action for Refugees I have had to analyse a manner of problems including financial matters, marketing strategies, communication tactics, event planning and reviewing applications for a number of roles. These experiences have taught me to look at things from multiple viewpoints and to pick the best solution/make the most optimal decision considering the circumstances and resources at hand.

### Self-led learner

I began my coding journey as a self-led learner by using resources from the internet to teach myself HTML, CSS and some JS as I began to complete small projects on Frontend Mentor. After some time, I began exploring Ruby and started to complete coding problems on websites such as Leetcode, CodeWars and CoderByte. As I increased my skills, my confidence grew and I was finally able to apply and be accepted onto the Makers Bootcamp. The Makers Bootcamp itself places a huge emphasis on self-led learning as the bootcamp is more about learning how to learn rather than strictly learning syntax and technologies; this experience has solidified my approach to learning and prepared me for life-long learning which a career in software engineering requires!

## What makes me happy (Interests) ü•∞

- Bouldering is the first sport I truly enjoyed and it's probably because of the amazing community surrounding it üßó‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- Love going to see ballet performances, inspiring to see the beautiful results of such hardwork & dedication ü©∞
- Winding down with some yoga is always a treat üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
