Hey, my name is Karolina. I'm a [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) graduate (Sept 2022). 

I fell in love with coding in 2020 in the middle of my Social Anthroplogy degree and since then I've been working towards beginning my career as a software engineer. What excites me about creating software is the constant need for elegant problem-solving and life-long learning, it means nothing will ever be boring and there will always be a cool new technology to get stuck into on the horizon! The idea of creating something that helps people in their daily-life and is potentially life-changing is also incredibly exciting and motivates me to constantly evolve, improve my craft and aim for greatness.

I strive to become an engineer that produces simple but great-quality code in collaboration with others which is why I am currently looking for my first software engineer role to take on new challenges at a company with the same values as mine.

## What I'm great at (Skills) üå±

### Project management & leading with empathy

I managed a team of 13 people to complete and present multiple media projects during my final year of university. All of our assignments were graded as firsts and I received even higher marks for my project management skills with feedback from my peers stating that they were grateful for how organised I was as it made their work easier to do. It was a really demanding but rewarding experience as it taught me scheduling and time-management, leadership, peer-review and above all communication skills. An interesting aspect of project management that I did not foresee before I took on the role was how much of the role was motivating others and building their confidence to complete their tasks. Therefore, I decided early on in the role that I wanted to lead with empathy and ensure that my team members always felt heard and could come to me with any problems that affected their ability to complete assignments, this was really important as university can be very stressful and many people have personal problems that make things even more difficult.
