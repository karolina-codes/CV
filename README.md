Hey, my name is Karolina. I'm a [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) graduate (Sept 2022). 

I fell in love with coding in 2020 in the middle of my Social Anthroplogy degree and since then I've been working towards beginning my career as a software engineer. What excites me about creating software is the constant need for elegant problem-solving and life-long learning, it means nothing will ever be boring and there will always be a cool new technology to get stuck into on the horizon! The idea of creating something that helps people in their daily-life and is potentially life-changing is also incredibly exciting and motivates me to constantly evolve and improve my craft.

I strive to become an engineer that produces great-quality code in collaboration with others which is why I am currently looking for my first software engineer role to take on new challenges at a company with the same values as mine. 

## Tech Stack
