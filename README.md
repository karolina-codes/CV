Hey, my name is Karolina. I'm a [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) graduate (Sept 2022).

I fell in love with coding in 2020 in the middle of my Social Anthroplogy degree and since then I've been working towards beginning my career as a software engineer. What excites me about creating software is the constant need for elegant problem-solving and life-long learning, it means nothing will ever be boring and there will always be a cool new technology to get stuck into on the horizon! The idea of creating something that helps people in their daily-life and is potentially life-changing is also incredibly exciting and motivates me to constantly evolve and aim for greatness.

I strive to become an engineer that produces simple but great-quality code in collaboration with others which is why I am currently looking for my first software engineer role to take on new challenges at a company with the same values as mine.

## <a name="experience">Work Experience</a> ü§†

**Trustee (Voluntary) | Student Action for Refugees (November 2020 to Present)**
- Communicated with the student network and collected feedback on how to improve our operational strategy. 
- Led conference events and chaired Q&A discussions. 
- Strategised in a team on how to improve our relationship with the student network to ensure we are consistently acting in a way that reflects our core values.
- Made decisions as part of multiple panels tasked with recruiting staff, trustees and improving our marketing strategy and creative identity.

**Patient Co-ordinator | Randox Laboratories (July 2021 to March 2022)** 
- Empathised with patients and clearly communicated to make them feel at ease in the clinic. 
- Followed a stringent protocol and created an organised sterile environment to process antigen tests.

## <a name="education">My Education (so far)</a> üë©‚Äçüéì

**Makers Academy (June to September 2022)**</br> 
A 16 week software engineering bootcamp where I was taught coding principles, technologies and agile practices.

- Learning Ruby taught me how to approach learning a language quickly by solving algorithmic problems and building apps. I was able to use the same approach to learn JavaScript later on in the bootcamp in a shorter timeframe which increased my confidence in tackling any coding technology. 
- We were strongly encouraged to follow **test-driven development** (RSpec, Jest) and it swiftly improved the quality of my code by making it cleaner and more robust as well as making **problem-solving** more efficient.
- The constant use of **pair-programming** was invaluable as it taught me how to communicate concepts and solutions to problems which is a skill that I am excited to further develop during my career.
- During group projects, I began to use agile practices such as **sprints, tickets and stand-ups/retros**; the benefits were immense as it allowed the team to work together seamlessly and consistently produce new features at a fast pace.  

**University of Essex (October 2019 to June 2022)**</br> 
BA (Hons) in Social Anthropology - 1st</br>

## <a name="skills">What I'm great at (Skills)</a> üå±

### Project management & leading with empathy üíõ

I managed a team of 13 people to complete and present multiple media projects during my final year of university. All of our assignments were graded as firsts and I received even higher marks for my project management skills with feedback from my peers stating that they were grateful for how organised I was as it made their work easier to do. It was a really demanding but rewarding experience as it taught me scheduling and time-management, leadership, peer-review and above all communication skills. 

An aspect of project management that I did not foresee before I took on the role was how much of the role was motivating others and building their confidence to complete their tasks. Therefore, I decided early on in the role that I wanted to lead with empathy and ensure that my team members always felt heard and could come to me with any problems that affected their ability to complete assignments, this was really important as university can be very stressful and many people have personal problems that make things even more difficult.

### Mentoring ü§ì

Mentoring has been something close to my heart for a long time, I sought out the opportunity to be a peer-mentor at university and kept in touch with 20 people during the year to ensure they had the support they needed to succeed. I also took up the opportunity to be a mentor during my time at Makers Academy which was a really special experience as I was always very grateful to my mentors when I began to code so it felt great to give back! I'd love to keep mentoring people throughout my career once I've gained more technical expertise as I believe it's super important to share knowledge and help others succeed.

### Analytical thinker & problem solver üß†

During my time as a trustee at Student Action for Refugees I have had to analyse a manner of problems including financial matters, marketing strategies, communication tactics, event planning and reviewing applications for a number of roles. For example, quarterly board meetings have taught me to collaborate with people from a variety of professional backgrounds; through these meetings I have also learnt to analyse financial reports and make recommendations based on the data. I was also a part of a team renewing our marketing strategy which resulted in a new brand identity and website! 

More technically, I love solving algorithmic problems so you'll often find me working on various problems and studying algorithms to crack them! I have also been brushing up on some data structures like linked lists and binary trees to exercise my problem-solving abilities. 

### Self-led learner ‚úè

I have been a self-led learner ever since I can remember as I've always sought out extra materials whether that be at school, during my A-levels by going to evening public lectures at UCL or at university by always going the extra mile and reading outside of my curriculum. 

I began my coding journey by using online resources to teach myself HTML, CSS and some JS and soona after I began to complete small projects on Frontend Mentor. Later on, I began exploring Ruby and started completing algorithmic problems on websites such as Leetcode, CodeWars and CoderByte. As I increased my skills, my confidence grew and I applied to the Makers Bootcamp. Makers itself places a huge emphasis on self-led learning as the bootcamp is more about learning how to learn rather than strictly learning syntax and technologies; this experience has solidified my approach to self-led learning and prepared me for a career which requires life-long learning and I couldn't be more excited to start!

## <a name="interests">What makes me happy (Interests)</a> ü•∞
